# Hanging Garden Component

  <Story name="Hanging Garden">
 { Garden}
  </Story>

<br/><br/>

## Arguments and types
<ArgsTable of={HangingGarden} />

## Arguments implementations
  Implementation and use of each argument. What it expects to receive and what its used for. 
  All example code reflects the Garden implementations in this story. 

### columns
  An array of columns to be shown in the Garden. 
  The array should be filled with an object for each columns. 
  Formatted like this: {key : ColumnName, data : Items[]}
  
  A key with name of the column. This can be anything you like. Often used as the text on the header. 
  Data  has an array of all the items that follows under each header. Data can be empty. 

  You will need to write your own functionality that determines how your columns should be structured. 
  In the example they are split into week/year. 

  How to set this up will be explored in the section below. 


### highlightedColumnKey
  Name(key) off a column in the columns object. 
  Highlights the column by giving the header a different color.
  This Garden will also scroll to this column on load. 
  
  HighlightedColumnKey can be null 
  No column wil be shown and garden will not scroll on initial load.

  
### highlightedItem
  Takes entire object of an item you want to highlight in the garden. 
  Item will receive be get a black outline when highlighted.
  The garden will also center the highlightedItem.

  highlightedItem can be null. 


### itemKeyProp
  A field in your item model that will serve as an identifier for renderedItems. 
  This should preferably be a unique field. 

  This filed is mandatory
  
### itemWidth
  A number of pixels, represents how wide your rendered items should be. 
  It is not possible to have variable columns width or variable widths withing same column.

  You will probably want to calculate this field. 
  As you might not now the length of the text or other objects you show on your rendered items. 

  In the example, we show the workorderNumbers for each item. 
  To figure the width we find the longest workorderNumber. 
  then add some additional pixels to it, and also a minimum length
  ```jsx
  const getItemWidth = () => {
        const longestKey = Math.max.apply
            Math
            data.map((workOrder) => workOrder.workOrderNumber.length
        )
        return Math.max(longestKey * 8 + 35, 102);
  };
  ```

  This will be a bit of an iterative process at first when creating your items. 
  Seeing how big they need to be to fit everything you need. 

  Long header text will override this. 
  Meaning if there is a header text that is longer longest item. The header length takes precedence.

### itemHeight
  The height of the rendered item. This follows the same principles as itemWidth.
  All items in the garden will be same height. 
  But hight can be controlled in same fashion as itemWidth. 

### headerHeight
  The height of the header row at the top of the garden. 
  This follows the same principles as itemWidth.
  All columns will have a header with the same header height. 
  But hight can be controlled in same fashion as itemWidth.



### getItemDescription
  This is a description of given item, that is shown when Header is expanded. 
  
  All headers has a clickEvent. When clicked the header will expand to the right. 
  Revealing an area where the itemDescription is shown. 

  The arguments takes in a function that receives the items and returns a string. 
  ```jsx
  (item: WorkOrderType) => item.description
  ```

  You can do more complex thing where if needed, but you are limited to returning a string.

### onItemClick
  A void function that receives the items object. 
  This function will fire when a rendered item is clicked. 

  in the example this is used to set the selected Item. 
  ```jsx
  (item: WorkOrderType) => setSelectedWorkOrder(item)
  ```
  This will then highlighted the item, and scroll to this item in the garden. 
  but this effect gives you a lot of possibilities to trigger other effect or UI elements might want. 
  A typical use case is to open a sidesheet with extended information. 



### provideController
  Takes in a ref that will give you ways to control the garden component. 
  As of now it only has one functions "clearGarden".
  This will clear all texture caches in the garden, and with that trigger a rerender of the garden. 
  
  A reason to use this is when you source data changes in a way that would change the rendered items. 
  Because these items are caches they would just use old data. 
  you can then call clearGarden() and the garden will be rebuilt from ground up. 

  so a general rule if you need to get the items in the garden to update their "look and feel", you would want to run this. 
  This does not need to be done for column changes, that is handled properly. 

  ```jsx
  const gardenController = React.useRef(null); 
  //Pass gardenController to Garden component in the provideController prop
  gardenController.current.clearGarden()
  ```

### backgroundColor
  Background color of the garden Defaults to white(16777215)
  
### renderItemContext
  A function that takes in the item object and context object. 
  The function will expand the context object by adding instruction for how items in the garden should be constructed. 

  Recommend looking at the ItemRenderContext model, to see your options here. 

  This is will quickly become a complex function and will be explored in its own section below.

### renderHeaderContext
  Similar to renderItemContext. 
  Takes in a key and context. 
  The key will be the column key that the header will represent. 
  Context will in similar fashion as renderItemContext be extended to dictated how the header looks. 

  Recommend looking at the HeaderRenderContext model, to see your options here. 

  This is will quickly become a complex function and will be explored in its own section below.



## Creating our own Hanging Garden 
  While the Hanging Garden component does a lot of the heavy lifting in terms of how and when the garden renders. 
  Or how to interact with the underlying PIXI.js engine. 
  It still requires quite a few inputs to get it working properly. 

  This sections will guide us though how to make a similar garden as the one in the example on top. 
  While also talking about some more advanced features that is not used here. 

  Be aware that it will demand a decent time investment setting up a Hanging Garden from scratch. 

### Getting Started - Data source 
  First things first, we will need a data source. 
  The data can be what ever we need it to be, but we should be aware of its model.
  Hanging Garden component is generic and takes in the model of the data we will be using. 

  ```jsx
  <HangingGarden<T> {...props} />
  ```
  We will be working with workorders, giving us a implementations like this.

  ```jsx
  <HangingGarden<WorkOrderType> {...props} />
  ```

### Creating Columns 
  Now that we have data and know what type of data we will be working with. 
  We can setup the columns structure. 

  This is all up to how its implemented. 
  The component has no recognition of how the columns are layed out, or how we sorted them. 
  Its just want an array full off HangingGardenColumn objects.

  in our example we will sort the data by year/week. Meaning each column represents a week in given year. 
  Then we check a specific field in each item and place it accordingly. 

  ```jsx
  getColumns = (data: WorkOrderType[]) => {
    const highlightedKey = getYearAndWeekFromDate(new Date());

    const newColumns = data.reduce<HangingGardenColumn<WorkOrderType>[]>((columns, commpkg) => {
        const key = commpkg.plannedStartDate ? getYearAndWeek(commpkg.plannedStartDate) : 'N/A';
        const column = columns.find((c) => c.key === key);
        column
            ? column.data.push({ ...commpkg, key })
            : columns.push({ key, data: [{ ...commpkg, key }] });
        return columns;
    }, []);

    const highlightedKeyIndex = newColumns.findIndex((c) => c.key === highlightedKey);
    if (highlightedKey && highlightedKeyIndex === -1) {
        newColumns.push({ key: highlightedKey, data: [] });
    }

    return newColumns.sort(({ key: a }, { key: b }) => a.localeCompare(b));
  };
  ```
  This function takes in all the data we have, then reduces the data into our columns array. 
  It find our key by getting back the key name from getYearAndWeek (example 2020/48). 
  Then decides if the column exists or not. If it exists we push the package into the data array. 
  Else we create a new object with this key and the item into the data property. 

  When that is done we have our columns that are technically ready to be sent into the Garden. 
  but we do a couple more things to the array. 
  First we check if the column we have as highlightedColumn exists, if not we add it. 

  Then we sort the array, so early the year week is ascending. 

  The Garden will not add, remove, sort or manipulate data in anyway on its own. 
  So make sure all is in order before sending it in. 
  Sorting the Items withing each columns is also something one should consider. 

#### highlightedColumnKey
  This is a good time to setup our highlightedColumn key if we want to use one. 
  Our example uses the current week as a highlighted column as shown above. 
  You want to make sure that this key string is also sent in to the garden. 

### Creating headers 
  before creating our header, we should consider our header height. 
  We might not now how big it should be. 
  Do we need to calculate it or is it static ?  
  In our example its a static 40. 
  This we can easily change if we see that its not the correct size later. 

  #### renderHeaderContext 
  create a new function with a signature like this.
  ```jsx
    const renderHeader = (key: string, context: HeaderRenderContext) => void
  ```
  Each column in columns will run this function and be added to the Garden as a Header with the instructions applied. 
  In our example it looks as follows

  ```jsx
  const renderHeader = (key: string, context: HeaderRenderContext) => {
        const textNode = context.createTextNode(
            context.isExpanded ? key + ' Expanded' || 'NA Expanded' : key || 'NA',
            context.isHighlighted ? 0xffffff : 0x243746
        );

        context.container.addChild(textNode);
        textNode.x = context.width / 2 - textNode.width / 2;
        textNode.y = textNode.height / 2;
  };
  ```
    createTextNode:
    function that takes 2 arguments. 
    String => text we want in our header. 
    Color => color of the text 
    returns an object that can be added to the garden. 
  
  We create a textNode and send in the text we want. 
  context.isExpanded is supplied by the context. Telling us if this column is in the expanded state. 
  Giving us an opportunity to change the text based on the expanded state. 
  The same goes for context.isHighlighted. We changes text color based on its state. 
  Highlighted is dark green, so we want white text. 

  We then add our textNode to the container. 
  The container is the column created for the Garden. 
  If the node is not added as a child it will not show up. 
  
  ```jsx
  context.container.addChild(textNode);
  textNode.x = context.width / 2 - textNode.width / 2;
  textNode.y = textNode.height / 2;
  ```
  The next two lines we adjust the placement of the text inside our header. 
  Making it centered both vertical and horizontal. 
  we use the context.width here. This is the width if our header. 
  There is also context.height for header height. 


  #### Advanced Headers
  We are free to add children to the context container at this point. 
  We can create another  textNode with context.CreateTextNode and add that. 
  Just be aware of the placement of the node. 

  We can also add graphics.  
  On the context we will find context.graphics. 
  This is the PIXI.Graphics object. It gives us a lot of freedom to create shapes and color in our header. 
  It would be advisable to look up the documentation for PIXI if you see the need for this. 

  a quick example for this 
  ```jsx 
  context.graphics.beginFill(0xffffff);
  context.graphics.drawRoundedRect(0,context.height - 5,context.width,5,4);
  context.graphics.endFill();
  ```
  This will draw a green line though our header. 
  BeginFill to chose color, start the drawing. 
  drawRoundedRect is a rectangle with rounded corner. We then add its coordinates inside the header as arguments. 
  where 0,0 is top left. Last argument is radius (rounded corner degree).
  This can for example be used to create a progress bar effect. 

### Creating item
Moving on to the items that will fill each column. 
Before starting we should consider a few properties.
What is our itemKeyProp. This needs to be a key in our item model. 
preferably something unique. 
Then the itemHeight and itemWidth. but again these can be easily adjusted if we see the need.

#### renderItemContext
  We again need to create a function similar to renderHeaderContext. 
  This functions receives the item current item and a context. 
  context has similarities with the header context but is not the same. 

  to start of our we items we need to create the rectangle. 
  ```jsx 
    const status = getFollowUpStatus(item);

        context.createRect(
            { x: 0, y: 0 },
            { width: context.width, height: context.height },
            followUpColorMapHex[status]
        );
  ```
  createRect creates the rectangle for us. it takes in a position, size and background color. 
  We here set the position to be top left. and use the full height and width off our container.
  In most circumstance, this is how we would set this up. 
  the last argument is color. We here have a function getFollowUpStatus that returns the items status. 
  We then have an array with different colors based on the items status. 
  Logic like we use here to get color is all up to us to create as we see fit. 
  but as with header, this code will run once per item in our garden.

  Next we need to set up the context.enquedRender. 
  This function takes in a string, this is used as an identifier. Preferably unique. 
  Then it takes a functions which will received the context object. 
  
  In this function we will draw everything we need onto our item. 
  ```jsx
  context.enquedRender(item.workOrderNumber, (context) => {
    const textNode = context.createTextNode(
        item.workOrderNumber,
        status === 'MaterialAndWoAvailable' ? 0x212121 : 0xffffff
    );
    context.graphics.addChild(textNode);
    textNode.x = 20;
    textNode.y = context.height / 2 - textNode.height / 2;
  });
  ```
  This is very similar to how we added text to to the header. Remark that we added the child to graphics here. 
  We here set the workorder number as text onto the item, then center it. 
  we also choose a text color based on status. 

  This is all that is needed to create an item. And our simple garden is now complete. 
  
  
#### Advanced items
We still have the same advanced options in the items as in th header. 
Inside enquedRender we can create multiple textNodes and graphics. 
Drawing graphics can be done in the same format as before. 
 ```jsx 
  context.graphics.beginFill(0xffffff);
  context.graphics.drawRoundedRect(0,context.height - 5,context.width,5,4);
  context.graphics.endFill();
  ```

The ItemRenderContext has a few functions that we have not discussed. 
This is some built in functionality and graphics. 
These are used outside of the context.enquedRender function. 

##### context.addDot
This is a function that will draw a rounded dot indicator on the item.
it takes in a color and position. 
In our example : 
```jsx 
context.addDot(getMatStatusColor(item), { x: context.width - 12, y: 8 });  
```
We get a different color again based on the item. 
Then place it in the top right corner. 

We can add multiple context.addDot to the renderItem function

##### context.addPopover 
This function is a hover effect for our item. 
It takes in a hit area and a function that returns the component we want to show. 

The hit are will need to be a PIXI shape. In most cases a rectangle will be a good fit. 
In our example: 
```jsx
context.addPopover(new PIXI.Rectangle(0, 0, context.width, context.height), () => (
            <ProjectPopover item={item} />
        ));
```
We create a PIXI.Rectangle. The rectangle takes in its arguments that decides it placement and size. 
In this example it covers our entire item.  
Then we give it a function that return our popover. 
The component is just any React component. We can make this anyway we like.
but it is still a hover and we will not be able to interact with it. 

In the same fashion as addDot, we can add as many popovers as we like. 
We just need to make sure we get our position and sizes right. 


### Some useful hooks 
The Garden component comes with some hooks that can be useful. 
These are not implemented in the garden in anyway, but can be used if found helpful. 

#### useHangingGardenData 
This hooks fetches data based on the currentContext and the supplied endpoint.
It also has built in functionality for cache invalidation and refetch data. 
That includes handling cache age. 
This is used in many Garden to give the user an indication of how old the data is. 
Also the ability to update the cache at will. 

#### useHangingGardenErrorMessage
This hook work well along side the useHangingGardenData hook. 
It take care of all know error or replies that can comeback from typical Hanging Garden endpoints.
The returned error from useHangingGardenData  can be feed directly into the this hook.
An errorMessage object will then be created, that again can be directly used by the default errorMessage component. 
No manual error check needs to be done. The hook handles this also. If there is no error, the errorMessage object will be flagged as such.
Handles errors are typical no data and "catch all" error. 
but also more garden typical errors for noCache and no access.
