            Right, and where am I gonna be? Well, Marty, I want to thank you for all your good
            advise, I'll never forget it. This is it. This is the answer. It says here that a bolt
            of lightning is gonna strike the clock tower precisely at 10:04 p.m. next Saturday
            night. If we could somehow harness this bolt of lightning, channel it into the flux
            capacitor, it just might work. Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the
            future. Hey, George, buddy, you weren't at school, what have you been doing all day?
            Lynda, first of all, I'm not your answering service. Second of all, somebody named Greg
            or Craig called you just a little while ago.
        </p>
        <p>
            Right. Thank you. In about thirty years. Whoa, whoa, okay. Next, please. I'm gonna ram
            him
        </p>
        <p>
            Hey, George, buddy, you weren't at school, what have you been doing all day? Hey beat
            it, spook, this don't concern you. He's an absolute dream. Check out that four by four.
            That is hot. Someday, Jennifer, someday. Wouldn't it be great to take that truck up to
            the lake. Throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back. Lie out under the stars.

                I'm gonna be at the dance. Well yeah, you know we have two of them. Excuse me. Oh
                honey, he's teasing you, nobody has two television sets. Oh yes sir.
            </p>
            <p>
                A bolt of lightning, unfortunately, you never know when or where it's ever gonna
                strike. Let him go, Biff, you're drunk. On the night I go back in time, you get-
                Doc. You wait and see, Mr. Caruthers, I will be mayor and I'll be the most powerful
                mayor in the history of Hill Valley, and I'm gonna clean up this town. It's cold,
                damn cold. Ha, ha, ha, Einstein, you little devil. Einstein's clock is exactly one
                minute behind mine, it's still ticking.
            </p>
            <p>
                What's a rerun? But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television
                program, Science Fiction Theater. Wait a minute, wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning?
                I don't like her, Marty. Any girl who calls a boy is just asking for trouble. Yeah,
                exactly.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm writing this down, this is good stuff. Hot, Jesus Christ, Doc. Jesus Christ,
                Doc, you disintegrated Einstein. Take that you mutated son-of-a-bitch. My pine, why
                you. You space bastard, you killed a pine. Hey Dad, George, hey, you on the bike.
                Yeah, sure, okay.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unroll their fire. Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe. What, what? Doc, she didn't
                even look at him. Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother.
                Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother.
            </p>
            <p>
                Well yeah, you know we have two of them. Marty, why are you so nervous? Hey, Doc, we
                better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88. Whoa, whoa, okay. Well,
                because George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Right. Kids, we're gonna have to eat this cake by ourselves, Uncle Joey didn't make
                parole again. I think it would be nice, if you all dropped him a line. Doc, you
                don't just walk into a store and ask for plutonium. Did you rip this off? Uh? Hey
                man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar.
            </p>
            <p>
                Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home. Its
                good. Go. What the hell is a gigawatt? Alright, alright, okay McFly, get a grip on
                yourself. It's all a dream. Just a very intense dream. Woh, hey, listen, you gotta
                help me.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's good advice, Marty. Where's Einstein, is he with you? We never would have
                fallen in love. Ho, you mean you're gonna touch her on her- Alright, alright, okay
                McFly, get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream. Just a very intense dream. Woh,
                hey, listen, you gotta help me.
            </p>
            <p>
                Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh? Doc Well, safe and sound, now, n
                good old 1955. He's alright. Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, great, you're alive.
                Do you know where 1640 Riverside- Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it you could
                accomplish anything.
